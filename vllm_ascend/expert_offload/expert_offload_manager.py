        relayout in _cast_cpu_weights_to_device_format — by transposing back
        to the original shape, casting 29, then transposing forward again, so
        the slot's format-29 layout is transpose(cast(original)). That is the

        transposeWeight from the layout (EZ1001 if base format, EZ0026 if the

        decode/prefill H2D at runtime (CPU buffer holds the matching NZ bytes);
        this call fixes the format + layout metadata.

        Fallback: some NPU devices/drivers only allow base format
        (allow_internal_format=False) and reject the format-29 cast at the ACL
        layer (device error 361001). This call only stamps format *metadata* on
        the resident slots — the bytes themselves are refreshed by decode/prefill
        H2D at runtime, and the fused-swiglu GMM path (DeepSeek-V4) reads them
        via raw storage, so skipping it is safe for V4. The SiTU raw
        npu_grouped_matmul path (Kimi-K3) checks the format and would reject
        fp4_e2m1 on base format (EZ1001); such models are unsupported on these
        devices. On the first cast failure we warn once and return, leaving the
        slots in base format. w.data is reassigned only after a successful cast,
